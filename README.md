## Final Experimentation 
1. This file contains EDA, Preprocessing, Featurisation and Model Experimentation.

## Final.ipnyb

This file contains the following functions:

Function-1

    Contains entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
    Takes raw data as input.
    Return predictions for your input. Here the input can be a single point or a set of points.
    def final_fun_1(X):
    .....
    .....
    ..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
    return predictions made on X ( Raw Data)

Function-2

    Should include entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
    It should take in raw data as input along with its target values.
    It should return the metric value that you are judging your models on.
    
    def final_fun_2(X,Y):
    .....
    .....
    ..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
    return final_metric computed on X ( Raw Data) and Y (target variable)
