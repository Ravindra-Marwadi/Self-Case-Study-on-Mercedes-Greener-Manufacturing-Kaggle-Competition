## Final.ipnyb

This file contains the following functions:

Function-1

    Contains entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
    Takes raw data as input.
    Return predictions for your input. Here the input can be a single point or a set of points.
    def final_fun_1(X):
    .....
    .....
    ..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
    return predictions made on X ( Raw Data)

Function-2

    Contains entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
    Takes raw data as input.
    Return predictions for your input. Here the input can be a single point or a set of points.
    
    def final_fun_2(X,Y):
    .....
    .....
    ..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
    return final_metric computed on X ( Raw Data) and Y (target variable)
